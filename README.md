# Notebooks 

This repository contains :

- The cancer example notebook complements the paper [Bridging Impulse Control of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes and Markov Decision Processes: Frameworks, Extensions, and Open Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04120) by *Alice Cleynen, Benoîte de Saporta, Orlane Rossini, Régis Sabbadin, and Amélie Vernay*.
- The squirrel example notebook illustrates the concepts discussed in the book A Comprehensive Guide to HSMM: Theory, Software, and Advanced Extensions by the same authors.
Both example are also developped in my phd thesis. 
Please note that depending on the reader’s entry point—whether through the thesis or the notebooks—notations may differ slightly between the manuscript and the code.

Both notebooks are available on Google Colab at the links below. Readers are encouraged to explore and interact with them directly online:
